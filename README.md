# PowerShell10YearPlanning
This repo will be used to store the documents for the PowerShell 10 Year Anniversary celebration planning docs.

The [planning document](https://github.com/JKeithB/PowerShell10YearPlanning/blob/master/PowerShell%2010-Year%20Anniversary%20Plan.md) will be used to organize the event. 

There are some materials provided as well, specifically:

* A very basic [PowerPoint presentation template](https://github.com/JKeithB/PowerShell10YearPlanning/blob/master/PowerShell10YearPresentationTemplate.potx)
* Two representations of the logo we will be reusing, in [JPG](https://github.com/JKeithB/PowerShell10YearPlanning/blob/master/PowerShell10YearLogo.jpg) and [PNG](https://github.com/JKeithB/PowerShell10YearPlanning/blob/master/PowerShell10YearLogo.png) formats.
